This contains neovim config file for my personal development editor

Uses [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) with [stow](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles)
 to organize my [neovim](https://neovim.io/) XDG config.
and brings under [git](https://github.com/grantmacken/dot://github.com/grantmacken/dots) control.

Its a mess, but its my mess.
